Hosanna!), may be the ultimate origin of the word.<ref>[http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/oeme_dictionaries.htm OEME Dictionaries]</ref> H\u01fdlan is likely a cognate of German Heil (meaning ''complete'' for things and ''healthy'' for beings) and other similar words of Germanic origin.  [[Bill Bryson]] asserts in his book ''Mother Tongue'' that \"hello\" comes from Old English ''h\u00e1l b\u00e9o \u00feu'' (\"Hale be thou\", or \"whole be thou\", meaning a wish for good health) (see also \"goodbye\" which is a contraction of \"God be with you\".\n\n==\"Hello, World\" computer program==\n{{Main|Hello world program}}\nStudents learning a new computer programming language will often begin by writing a [[Hello world program|\"Hello, world!\" program]], which outputs that greeting to a display screen or printer. The widespread use of this tradition arose from an introductory chapter of the book ''[[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]]'' by Kernighan & Ritchie, which reused the following example taken from earlier memos by Brian Kernighan at Bell Labs:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n int main() \n {\n        printf(\"hello, world\");\n }</source>\n\n==The Apple DOS HELLO program==\n\nA diskette formatted to boot [[Apple DOS]] 3.x on the Apple II series of computers will look for a BASIC program to run automatically after the operating system has booted. By default, the name of the program is HELLO, and is specified as a parameter of the INIT command used to format a floppy disk. For the HELLO program to work, it has to be created in the same language ([[Integer BASIC]] or [[Applesoft BASIC]]) that is present in the language ROM of the system the disk is being booted on.\n\n== Perception of \"Hello\" in other nations ==\n\nIn some other nations, especially the ones that had little contact with foreigners at the time, Westerners were often viewed as people who constantly said \"hello\" and little else. Chinese novelist [[Jung Chang]] describes this view as follows:\n{{quote|In my mind... foreigners said 'hello' all the time, with an odd intonation....
